SDK to develop Smart-Contracts in Self-sovereign-identity environment
=======================================================================
Sirius Smart-Contract is `distributed state-machine <https://github.com/dhh1128/distributed-state-machine/blob/master/README.md>`_ driven by `Edge-Chain protocol <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0003-protocols>`_ that approved by participants. Sirius SDK is entry point to develop distributed machines that acts as whole smart-contract.

Key Features
============

- Develop state-machines over `protocols <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0003-protocols#aries-rfc-0003-protocols>`_ in blocking develoment style avoiding **Callback Hell**.
- Supports `Aries concepts <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts>`_ and `features <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features>`_.
- Make it easy to solve identity problem, tune complex identity task for your demand:

  - Setup `Indy Agent <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0004-agents>`_ in Cloud (Sirius Hub) or deploy self developed one
  - Configure private keys management system on your side: database, **HSM**, `Indy Wallet <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0050-wallets>`_, etc.
  - Configure Trust environment with your contragents via `Microledgers <https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol#the-relationship-agent-plane>`_, `Sovrin Network <https://sovrin.org/>`_, other `Indy Ledgers <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0051-dkms>`_, `Triple Signed Receips <https://opentransactions.org/wiki/Triple-Signed_Receipts>`_, **Merkle-Proofs** out of the box.
- Define specific consensus procedures through state-machines that progress states of participants in `Transport-Agnostic <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0025-didcomm-transports/README.md>`_ environment - save money on IT-infrastructure.
