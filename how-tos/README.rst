========================================================================================================================================
How-tos guide for business automation with Sirius approach via blockchain and Smart-Contracts in style of Self-sovereign identity.
========================================================================================================================================

**All samples are tested in Python 3.8**

- `Setup developer environment <https://github.com/Sirius-social/sirius-sdk-python/tree/master/how-tos/setup_environment>`_ example
   shows how to initialize the development environment to start.
- `P2P connections and Hyperledger Indy Pairwise <https://github.com/Sirius-social/sirius-sdk-python/tree/master/how-tos/create_connections>`_
   covers Peer-To-Peer instantiation among independent participants that solve cyber-security issues.
   Also, this document will dive into the building blocks for Smart-Contracts developing in digital markets
   and the place of **Sirius** in that discussion.
- `Distributed state machines <https://github.com/Sirius-social/sirius-sdk-python/tree/master/how-tos/distributed_state_machines>`_
   will familiarize readers with the distributed state machines concept. This concept is the fundament block of the economic
   and technological value of **Sirius**.
- `Indy Anon-Creds implementation <https://github.com/Sirius-social/sirius-sdk-python/tree/master/how-tos/anon_credentials>`_
   will demonstrate how **Sirius SDK** helps to implement complex tasks and SSI protocols.
- `Robotic process automation <https://github.com/Sirius-social/sirius-sdk-python/tree/master/how-tos/robotic_process_automation>`_
   will cover how **Sirius** may help to involve humans to **Trusted** environments driven by SSI.
- `Consensus implementation as distributed-state-machine <https://github.com/Sirius-social/sirius-sdk-python/tree/master/how-tos/pluggable_consensus>`_
   Doc will show why `Star battle ship <https://github.com/Sirius-social/sirius-sdk-python/tree/master/how-tos/distributed_state_machines#example>`_
   example is not Byzantine-full and we will discuss the tricks that solve same issues with **Sirius SDK**.
   Distributed state machines and pluggable consensus.
- `Sirius Smart-Contracts <https://github.com/Sirius-social/sirius-sdk-python/tree/master/how-tos/smart_contracts>`_
   Separation of imperative and declarative logic, pluggable consensus, trust and business-logic over co-protocols.
   App centralization continuum and useful outcomes.
